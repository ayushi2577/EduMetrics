## What Is EduMetrics?

EduMetrics is an academic advisory intelligence platform built for college advisors. It connects to a college's existing database — attendance, assignments, quizzes, library usage — and surfaces **who needs attention this week**, complete with plain-English explanations of why.

The platform is built around a core belief: **advisors have limited time and many students.** EduMetrics makes sure that time is spent on the students who need it most, with the right context to act effectively.

## The Problem

Most colleges track student data. Very few use it proactively. An advisor managing 60+ students has no practical way to know that **a student's attendance dropped 18% over the last 3 weeks**, or that **someone hasn't submitted an assignment in 12 days** — until it shows up as a fail on a result sheet. By that point, intervention is too late.

EduMetrics closes that gap. Every week, the system recalculates metrics for every student and surfaces a ranked triage list: exactly who to reach out to, why, and with what context.

---

## Architecture

EduMetrics uses a **dual-database design**: it reads from the college's existing database (read-only) and writes its own analytics results to a separate analysis database. The college's data is never modified.

```
┌──────────────────┐     Django ORM      ┌────────────────────────┐
│   Client DB      │  ◀── (read-only) ── │                        │

│                  │                     │   (Python / Django)    │

│  Attendance      │                     │  weekly_metrics_       │
│  Assignments     │                     │    calculator.py       │
│  Quizzes         │                     │  flagging.py           │
│  Library visits  │                     │  pre_mid_term.py       │
│  Exam results    │                     │  pre_end_term.py       │
└──────────────────┘                     │  pre_sem.py            │
                                         └────────────┬───────────┘
┌──────────────────┐                                  │ writes
│   Analysis DB    │  ◀───────────────────────────────┘
│  (EduMetrics)    │
│                  │
│  WeeklyMetrics   │
│  WeeklyFlag      │
│  PreMidTerm      │
│  PreEndTerm      │
│  Predictions     │
│  Watchlists      │
└──────────────────┘
```

Database routing is handled automatically — all `ClientXxx` models route to `client_db`, all analysis models route to `default`.

## Analytics Engine

### Weekly Metrics (`weekly_metrics_calculator.py`)

Every week, the engine computes two scores per student:

**Effort Score** — measures behavioural engagement across 6 signals:

| Signal | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Library visits | 25% |
| Book borrows | 20% |
| Assignment quality | 20% |
| Plagiarism penalty | 15% |
| Attendance rate | 10% |
| Quiz + assignment submission rate | 10% |

**Academic Performance Score** — a weighted composite of the student's last 3 weeks, with more recent weeks weighted higher (40 / 30 / 30).

Both scores are written to the `WeeklyMetrics` table in the analysis DB. Exam weeks (Week 8 midterm, Week 18 end-term) are excluded from trend calculations to avoid distorting the baseline.

### Weekly Flagging (`flagging.py`)

After metrics are computed, the flagging engine identifies students who need advisor attention. It:

- Reads the current simulator week and derives semester context (odd/even slot, current semester per class)
- Computes a 4-week baseline window (excluding exam weeks) to detect meaningful deviations
- Applies a **grace period** for the first 3 weeks of semester (flags are softer while patterns establish)
- Tracks **escalation memory** — students who were flagged last week are escalated, not re-flagged from scratch
- Writes triage results to `WeeklyFlag` with plain-English reasons

### Semester Analysis Windows

Analysis runs at 5 points in the semester, triggered by the scheduler or manually:

| Module | When | What It Does |
|--------|------|--------------|
| `pre_sem.py` | Start of semester | Generates a watchlist based on prior semester performance |
| `weekly_metrics_calculator.py` + `flagging.py` | Every week | Computes scores, flags at-risk students |
| `pre_mid_term.py` | Before Week 8 | Predicts midterm exam scores, flags students at risk of failing |
| `pre_end_term.py` | Before Week 18 | Predicts end-term outcomes, generates pass/fail risk per student |
| Post-analysis | After results | Compares actuals to predictions, identifies underperformers |

---

## REST API

Built with Django REST Framework. Key endpoints (all in `analysis_engine/`):

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/flagged/` | GET | Weekly triage list filtered by semester, week, and class |
| `/class-performance/` | GET | Aggregated performance for a class |
| `/student-performance/` | GET | Individual student metrics for a given week |
| `/pre-midterm/` | GET | Pre-midterm predictions per student |
| `/pre-endterm/` | GET | End-term risk predictions |
| `/risk-of-failing/` | GET | Per-subject fail risk predictions |
| `/watchlist/` | GET | Pre-semester watchlist |
| `/calibrate/` | POST | Triggers a full recalibration of the analysis DB |

A custom database router (`routers.py`) handles directing reads/writes to the correct database automatically.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3.11+
PostgreSQL (or Supabase)
Git
```

### 1. Clone and set up the environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EduMetrics.git
cd EduMetrics/backend

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure databases

EduMetrics requires two PostgreSQL databases: one for the college's existing data (or a replica/seed), and one for the analysis results.

Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:

```env
# Analysis DB (EduMetrics writes here)
DEFAULT_DB_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/edumetrics_analysis

# Client DB (college data — read-only)
CLIENT_DB_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/college_data

SECRET_KEY=your-long-random-secret-key
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

Generate a secret key:
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

### 3. Run migrations

```bash
# Migrate the analysis DB
python manage.py migrate

# The client DB is read-only (managed=False models) — no migrations needed for it
```

### 4. Start the server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
# API available at http://localhost:8000
```

### 5. Run the weekly analysis

```bash
# Via management command
python manage.py run_weekly

# Or trigger via API (POST to /api/calibrate/)
```

---

## Authentication

EduMetrics uses JWT authentication via `djangorestframework-simplejwt`. A custom `Users` model is set as `AUTH_USER_MODEL`.

Obtain a token:
```
POST /api/token/
{ "username": "...", "password": "..." }
```

Include in subsequent requests:
```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

---

## Database Schema (Analysis DB)

The tables EduMetrics writes to:

| Table | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| `weekly_metrics` | Per-student effort score + academic performance, per week |
| `weekly_flags` | Triage output — flagged students with risk level and reasons |
| `pre_mid_term` | Predicted midterm scores and at-risk flags |
| `pre_end_term` | End-term pass/fail risk per student |
| `risk_of_failing_prediction` | Per-subject failure probability |
| `pre_sem_watchlist` | Start-of-semester carry-over watchlist |
| `intervention_log` | Advisor intervention records |

The client DB schema (college data) is accessed through `ClientXxx` unmanaged models and is never modified by EduMetrics.

## Contributing

1. Branch from `main` → `feature/your-feature-name`
